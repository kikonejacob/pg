# concepts

Unlike the other tiny experiments here, this is an experiment in a complete app.

Concepts are just little ideas I want to remember, then have shuffled and presented with other concepts to induce lateral thinking.

# files

* **schema.sql** Basic database schema
* **views.sql** Views used for JSON responses
* **functions.sql** Operational functions
* **api.sql** Functions returning MIME + JSON for HTTP API
* **fixtures.sql** Data for testing
* **sql.m4** USAGE: `m4 sql.m4 > sql.sql`
* **sql.sql** generated by m4 (do not edit directly)
* **test.rb** Unit test for SQL functions
* **routes.rb** HTTP API in Sinatra *(beautiful, isn't it?)*
* **config.ru** Run `rackup` to start HTTP webserver
* **test-rack.rb** Clone of test.rb for HTTP API

## status: finished! works!
