# Copy longer fields

Sample of function I'm using for people-merging:

Given two people records, copy field values from fields whose values are longer in the older than the newer one.  *(There's surely a clearer way to write that sentence!)*

## status:  done, but ugly

I couln't figure out how to do dynamic queries using column names in an array.

See FUNCTION copylong2.

Any suggestions?
